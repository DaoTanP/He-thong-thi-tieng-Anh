('DV-1', 'It is difficult to write rules that tell exactly when we should apologize, but it is not difficult to learn how. If we have done something to hurt someone\'s feeling or if we have been impolite or rude, we should apologize. An apology indicates that we realize we have made a mistake, and we are sorry for it. It is a way of expressing our regret for something. When we apologize, we admit our wrongdoing, usually offer a reason for it, and express regret.\nThe simplest way to apologize is to say \"I\'m sorry\", but often that is not enough. Let\'s take a common situation. Mario is late for class and enters the classroom, interrupting the teacher in the middle of the class. What does he do? The most polite action is usually to take a seat as quietly as possible and apologize later. But if the teacher stops and waits for him to say something, he could apologize simply \"I\'m sorry I\'m late\", ask permission to take his seat, and sit down. Naturally, more than this, a reason for the tardiness, is needed, but this is not the time or the place for it because he has already caused one interruption and doesn\'t need to make it any longer or worse than it already is.', 'Is it difficult to learn how to apologize somebody?', 'Đoạn văn', 'Yes, it is.', 'not difficult.', 'No, it isn\'t.', 'No, hasn\'t.', 'C', ''),
('DV-10', 'On the fourth Thursday in November, in houses around the United States, families get together for a feast, or a large meal. Almost all families eat turkey and cranberry sauce for this meal, and have pumpkin pie for dessert. This feast is part of a very special day, the holiday of Thanksgiving.\nIn 1620 the Pilgrims made a difficult trip across the ocean from England. They landed in what is now Massachusetts. In England the Pilgrims had not been allowed to freely practice their religion. So they went to the New World in search of religious freedom.\nThe Pilgrims\' first winter was very hard. Almost half the group died of cold, hunger and disease. But the Indians of Massachusetts taught the Pilgrims to plant corn, to hunt and to fish. When the next fall came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food. They were thankful to God and the Indians and had a feast to give thanks. They invited the Indians to join them. This was the first Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving became a national holiday many years later because of the effort of a woman named Sarah Hale. For forty years Sarah Hale wrote to each president and asked for a holiday of Thanksgiving. At last she was successful. In 1863 President Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a holiday.\nHow much is Thanksgiving today like the Pilgrims\' Thanksgiving? In many ways they are different. For example, historians think that the Pilgrims ate deer, not turkey. The idea of Thanksgiving, though, is very much the same: Thanksgiving is a day on which we celebrate and give thanks.', 'The word \"they\" in paragraph 3 refer to _______', 'Đoạn văn', 'families', 'the Pilgrims', 'thanks', 'the Native Americans', 'B', ''),
('DV-100', 'In the history of technology, computers and calculators were innovative developments. They are essentially different from all other machines because they have a memory. This memory stores instructions and information. In a calculator, the instructions are the various functions of arithmetic, which are permanently remembered by the machine and cannot be altered or added to. The information consists of the numbers keyed in.\nAn electronic pocket calculator can perform almost instant arithmetic. A calculator requires an input unit to feed in numbers, a processing unit to make the calculation, a memory unit, and an output unit to display the result. The calculator is powered by a small battery or by a panel of solar cells. Inside is a microchip that contains the memory and processing units and also controls the input unit, which is the keyboard, and the output unit, which is the display.\nThe input unit has keys for numbers and operations. Beneath the key is a printed circuit board containing a set of contacts for each key. Pressing a key closes the contacts and sends a signal along a pair of lines in the circuit board to the processing unit, in which the binary code for that key is stored in the memory. The processing unit also sends the code to the display. Each key is connected by a different pair of lines to the processing unit, which repeatedly checks the lines to find out when a pair is linked by a key.\nThe memory unit stores the arithmetic instructions for the processing unit and holds the temporary results that occur during calculation. Storage cells in the memory unit hold the binary codes for the keys that have been pressed. The number codes, together with the operation code for the plus key,   are    held    in    temporary    cells    until    the    processing    unit    requires them. When the equals key is pressed, it sends a signal to the processing unit. This takes the operation code-for example, addition-and the two numbers being held in the memory unit and performs the operation on the two numbers. A full adder does the addition, and the result goes to the decoder in the calculator\'s microchip. This code is then sent to the liquid crystal display unit, which shows the result, or output, of the calculation.', 'The word \"This\" in paragraph 5 refers to ___________', 'Đoạn văn', 'the plus key', 'the processing unit', 'the memory unit', 'the equals key', 'B', ''),

Should a woman who works at home, doing the housework and caring for children, be paid for her service?

This rate was based on a family composed of a husband, wife, and three young children. The $ 11,600 is what the husband would have to pay if he hired others to take over his wife\'s household chores. The researchers concluded that it would be fair for husbands to pay wives according to federal guidelines for minimum wages.\nAnother plan for rewarding women who work at home has been suggested by a former Secretary of Health and Human Services. He says that full-time housewives should be allowed to pay social security taxes, with their employers contributing part of the payment. He feels that the present system is unfair.

('DV-4', 'It is difficult to write rules that tell exactly when we should apologize, but it is not difficult to learn how. If we have done something to hurt someone\'s feeling or if we have been impolite or rude, we should apologize. An apology indicates that we realize we have made a mistake, and we are sorry for it. It is a way of expressing our regret for something. When we apologize, we admit our wrongdoing, usually offer a reason for it, and express regret.\nThe simplest way to apologize is to say \"I\'m sorry\", but often that is not enough. Let\'s take a common situation. Mario is late for class and enters the classroom, interrupting the teacher in the middle of the class. What does he do? The most polite action is usually to take a seat as quietly as possible and apologize later. But if the teacher stops and waits for him to say something, he could apologize simply \"I\'m sorry I\'m late\", ask permission to take his seat, and sit down. Naturally, more than this, a reason for the tardiness, is needed, but this is not the time or the place for it because he has already caused one interruption and doesn\'t need to make it any longer or worse than it already is.', 'What is the simplest way to apologize?', 'Đoạn văn', 'We express our regret.', 'We said nothing.', 'We say \"I\'m sorry\".', 'We admit our wrongdoing.', 'C', ''),

Although much of this tea is consumed in Asian, European and African countries, the United States drinks its fair share.

Black tea or green tea – iced, spiced or instant – tea drinking has spurred a billion-dollar with major tea producer in Africa and South America and throughout Asia.\nTea is made from the leaves from an evergreen plant, Camellia saneness, which grows tall and lush in tropical region. On tea plantation, the plant is kept trimmed to approximately four feet high and as new buds called flush appear; they are plucked off by hand. Even in today\'s world of modern agricultural machinery, hand harvesting continues to be the preferred method. Ideally, only the top two leaves and a bud should be picked. This new growth produces the highest quality tea.\nAfter being harvested, tea leaves are laid out on long drying racks, called withering racks, for 18 to 20 hours. During this process, the tea softens and become limp. Next, dependent on the type of tea being product, the leaves may be crushed or chopped to release flavor, and then fermented under controlled condition of heat and humidity. For green tea, the whole leaves are often steamed to retain their green color, and the fermentation process is skipped. Producing black teas requires fermentation during which the tea leaves begin darken. After fermentation, black tea is dried in vats to produce its rich brown or black color.\nNo one knows when or how tea became popular, but legend has it that tea as a beverage was discovered in 2737 B.C. by Emperor Shen Nung of China when leaves from camellia dropped into his drinking water as it was boiling over a fire. As the story goes, Emperor Shen Nung drank the resulting liquid and proclaimed that the drink to be most nourishing and refreshing. Though this account cannot be documented, it is thought that tea drinking probably originated in China and spread to other parts of Asia, then Europe, and ultimately to America colonies around 1650.\nWith about half the caffeine content of coffee, tea is often chosen by those who want to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate their caffeine intake. Some people find that tea is less acidic than coffee and therefore easier on the stomach.

('DV-5', 'It is difficult to write rules that tell exactly when we should apologize, but it is not difficult to learn how. If we have done something to hurt someone\'s feeling or if we have been impolite or rude, we should apologize. An apology indicates that we realize we have made a mistake, and we are sorry for it. It is a way of expressing our regret for something. When we apologize, we admit our wrongdoing, usually offer a reason for it, and express regret.\nThe simplest way to apologize is to say \"I\'m sorry\", but often that is not enough. Let\'s take a common situation. Mario is late for class and enters the classroom, interrupting the teacher in the middle of the class. What does he do? The most polite action is usually to take a seat as quietly as possible and apologize later. But if the teacher stops and waits for him to say something, he could apologize simply \"I\'m sorry I\'m late\", ask permission to take his seat, and sit down. Naturally, more than this, a reason for the tardiness, is needed, but this is not the time or the place for it because he has already caused one interruption and doesn\'t need to make it any longer or worse than it already is.', 'It is ________ to write the rules that tell exactly when we should apologize.', 'Đoạn văn', 'common', 'simple', 'easy', 'difficult', 'D', ''),

Refrigeration produces few changes in food, so meats, fish, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables keep their original flavor, color, and nutrition. Before artificial refrigeration was invented, people stored perishable food with ice or snow to lengthen its storage time. Preserving food by keeping it in an ice-filled pit is a 4,000-year-old art. Cold storage areas were built in basements, cellars, or caves, lined with wood or straw, and packed with ice. The ice was transported from mountains, or harvested from local lakes or rivers, and delivered in large blocks to homes and businesses.\nArtificial refrigeration is the process of removing heat from a substance, container, or enclosed area, to lower its temperature. The heat is moved from the inside of the container to the outside. A refrigerator uses the evaporation of a volatile liquid, or refrigerant, to absorb heat. In most types of refrigerators, the refrigerant is compressed, pumped through a pipe, and allowed to vaporize. As the liquid turns to vapor, it loses heat and gets colder because the molecules of vapor use energy to leave the liquid. The molecules left behind have less energy and so the liquid becomes colder. Thus, the air inside the refrigerator is chilled.\nScientists and inventors from around the world developed artificial refrigeration during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. William Cullen demonstrated artificial refrigeration in Scotland in 1748, when he let ethyl ether boil into a partial vacuum. In 1805, American inventor Oliver Evans designed the first refrigeration machine that used vapor instead of liquid. In 1842, physician John Gorrie used Evans\'s design to create an air-cooling apparatus to treat yellow-fever patients in a Florida hospital. Gorrie later left his medical practice and experimented with ice making, and in 1851 he was granted the first U.S. patent for mechanical refrigeration. In the same year, an Australian printer, James Harrison, built an ether refrigerator after noticing that when he cleaned his type with ether it became very cold as the ether evaporated. Five years later, Harrison introduced vapor-compression refrigeration to the brewing and meatpacking industries.\nBrewing was the first industry in the United States to use mechanical refrigeration extensively, and in the 1870s, commercial refrigeration was primarily directed at breweries. German-born Adolphus Busch was the first to use artificial refrigeration at his brewery in St. Louis. Before refrigeration, brewers stored their beer in caves, and production was constrained by the amount of available cave space. Brewing was strictly a local business since beer was highly perishable and shipping it any distance would result in spoilage. Busch solved the storage problem with the commercial vapor- compression refrigerator. He solved the shipping problem with the newly invented refrigerated railcar, which was insulated with ice bunkers in each end. Air came in on the top, passed through the bunkers, and circulated through the car by gravity. In solving Busch\'s spoilage and storage problems, refrigeration also revolutionized an entire industry. By 1891, nearly every brewery was equipped with mechanical refrigerating machines.\nThe refrigerators of today rely on the same basic principle of cooling caused by the rapid evaporation and expansion of gases.

Refrigeration produces few changes in food, so meats, fish, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables keep their original flavor, color, and nutrition. Before artificial refrigeration was invented, people stored perishable food with ice or snow to lengthen its storage time. Preserving food by keeping it in an ice-filled pit is a 4,000-year-old art. Cold storage areas were built in basements, cellars, or caves, lined with wood or straw, and packed with ice. The ice was transported from mountains, or harvested from local lakes or rivers, and delivered in large blocks to homes and businesses.\nArtificial refrigeration is the process of removing heat from a substance, container, or enclosed area, to lower its temperature. The heat is moved from the inside of the container to the outside. A refrigerator uses the evaporation of a volatile liquid, or refrigerant, to absorb heat. In most types of refrigerators, the refrigerant is compressed, pumped through a pipe, and allowed to vaporize. As the liquid turns to vapor, it loses heat and gets colder because the molecules of vapor use energy to leave the liquid. The molecules left behind have less energy and so the liquid becomes colder. Thus, the air inside the refrigerator is chilled.\nScientists and inventors from around the world developed artificial refrigeration during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. William Cullen demonstrated artificial refrigeration in Scotland in 1748, when he let ethyl ether boil into a partial vacuum. In 1805, American inventor Oliver Evans designed the first refrigeration machine that used vapor instead of liquid. In 1842, physician John Gorrie used Evans\'s design to create an air-cooling apparatus to treat yellow-fever patients in a Florida hospital. Gorrie later left his medical practice and experimented with ice making, and in 1851 he was granted the first U.S. patent for mechanical refrigeration. In the same year, an Australian printer, James Harrison, built an ether refrigerator after noticing that when he cleaned his type with ether it became very cold as the ether evaporated. Five years later, Harrison introduced vapor-compression refrigeration to the brewing and meatpacking industries.\nBrewing was the first industry in the United States to use mechanical refrigeration extensively, and in the 1870s, commercial refrigeration was primarily directed at breweries. German-born Adolphus Busch was the first to use artificial refrigeration at his brewery in St. Louis. Before refrigeration, brewers stored their beer in caves, and production was constrained by the amount of available cave space. Brewing was strictly a local business since beer was highly perishable and shipping it any distance would result in spoilage. Busch solved the storage problem with the commercial vapor- compression refrigerator. He solved the shipping problem with the newly invented refrigerated railcar, which was insulated with ice bunkers in each end.

For a few, it is not being able to take a “sickie” once a month. Then there is a group of people for whom working every evening and weekend is normal, and frantic is the tempo of their lives.  For most senior executives, workloads swing between extremely busy and frenzied. The vice-president of the management consultancy AT Kearney and its head of telecommunications for the Asia-Pacific region, Neil Plumridge, says his work weeks vary from a “manageable” 45 hours to 80 hours, but average 60 hours. Three warning signs alert Plumcidge about his workload: sleep, scheduling and family. He knows he has too much on when he gets less than six hours of sleep for three consecutive nights; when he is constantly having to reschedule appointments; “and the third one is on the family side”, says Plumridge, the father of a three year-old daughter, and expecting a second child in October. \"If I happen to miss a birthday or anniversary, I know things are out of control.” Being \"too busy\" is highly subjective. But for any individual, the perception of being too busy over a prolonged period can start showing up as stress: disturbed sleep, and declining mental and physical health. National workers\' compensation figures show stress causes the most lost time of any workplace injury. Employees suffering stress are off work an average of 16.6 weeks. The effects of stress are also expensive. \nComcare, the Federal Government insurer, reports that in 2003-04, claims for psychological injury accounted for 7% of claims but almost 27% of claim costs. Experts say the key to dealing with stress is not to focus on relief -a game of golf or a massage - but to reassess workloads. Neil Plumridge says he makes it a priority to work out what has to change; that might mean allocating extra resources to a job, allowing more time or changing expectations. The decision may take several days. He also relies on the advice of colleagues, saying his peers coach each other with business problems. \"Just a fresh pair of eyes over an issue can help,\" he says. \n(Source: www.ielts-mentor.com)', 'The word \"reassess\" in the second paragraph is closest in meaning to _____.', 'Đoạn văn', 'reevaluate', 'reacquaint', 'redeem', 'recapture', 'A', ''),

In Britain, universities are getting ready to enroll more overseas students. The British Council has published a report predicting that overseas student numbers could soar to more than 800,000 by 2018. In 2010, figures put the total at over 400,000 international students out of two and a half million students in UK higher education and it is clear that this influx is having an enormous impact on universities and colleges. These students bring welcome fees, of course, but they are also likely to be very intelligent students who inject new cultural influences and bring changes to the old university systems. Their demand for vocational subjects such as business, biotechnology and information technology, rather than traditional academic subjects, is affecting what is taught as well. \nThe impressive expansion of foreign students has already had a significant impact on higher education.  Overseas student numbers, including European Union students, have risen from 270,000 in 2002 to 400,000 in 2010. During this time the number from China jumped more than tenfold, and numbers from India have been going up. In contrast, the number of students from other countries has fallen, reflecting their governments’ efforts to educate more of their young people at home, as well as competition from Australia and the USBut as the Asian tiger economies expand their own universities, the good news for places like the London School of Economics is that there are more and more graduates looking to improve their qualifications or to pursue research in their subjects. \n(Adapted from Achieve IELTS by Louis Harrison, Caroline Cushen and Susan Hutchison)', 'What is the passage mainly about?', 'Đoạn văn', 'The decline in the number of overseas students at Western universities', 'How to become an overseas student', 'How to avoid culture shock when living in Western countries', 'How international students are changing Western university life', 'D', ''),

('THPTQG-43', 'Universities love overseas students – they are clever and hardworking, they bring different cultures to seminars and student life and they pay their way. In Britain, universities are getting ready to enroll more overseas students. The British Council has published a report predicting that overseas student numbers could soar to more than 800,000 by 2018. In 2010, figures put the total at over 400,000 international students out of two and a half million students in UK higher education and it is clear that this influx is having an enormous impact on universities and colleges. These students bring welcome fees, of course, but they are also likely to be very intelligent students who inject new cultural influences and bring changes to the old university systems. Their demand for vocational subjects such as business, biotechnology and information technology, rather than traditional academic subjects, is affecting what is taught as well. \nThe impressive expansion of foreign students has already had a significant impact on higher education.  Overseas student numbers, including European Union students, have risen from 270,000 in 2002 to 400,000 in 2010. During this time the number from China jumped more than tenfold, and numbers from India have been going up. In contrast, the number of students from other countries has fallen, reflecting their governments’ efforts to educate more of their young people at home, as well as competition from Australia and the USBut as the Asian tiger economies expand their own universities, the good news for places like the London School of Economics is that there are more and more graduates looking to improve their qualifications or to pursue research in their subjects. \n(Adapted from Achieve IELTS by Louis Harrison, Caroline Cushen and Susan Hutchison)', 'According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?', 'Đoạn văn', 'Foreign students’ abilities are often underestimated by Western universities.', 'The number of foreign students from India has fallen over a specific period of time.', 'Some countries tried to persuade their young students to pursue their education at home.', 'The number of overseas students in Britain has already reached its limit.', 'C', ''),

('THPTQG-44', 'People have been donating blood since the early twentieth century to help accident victims and patients undergoing surgical procedures. Usually a pint of whole blood is donated, and it is then divided into platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells. People can donate blood (for red blood cells) about once every two \nmonths. Transfusing the blood from the donor to the recipient is straightforward. It involves taking the blood from a donor’s arm vein by means of a hypodermic syringe. The blood flows through a plastic tube to a collection bag or bottle that contains sodium citrate, which prevents the blood from clotting. When the blood is given to a patient, a plastic tube and hypodermic needle are connected to the recipient\'s arm. The blood flows down from the container by gravity. This is a slow process and may last as long as 2 hours to complete the infusion of blood into the recipient. The patient is protected from being infected during the transfusion. Only sterile containers, tubing, and needles are used, and this helps ensure that transfused or stored blood is not exposed to disease causing bacteria. Negative reactions to transfusions are not unusual.  The recipient may suffer an allergic reaction or be sensitive to donor leukocytes. Some may suffer from an undetected red cell incompatibility. Unexplained reactions are also fairly common. Although they are rare, other causes of such negative reactions include contaminated blood, air bubbles in the blood, overloading of the circulatory system through administration of excess blood, or sensitivity to donor plasma or platelets. Today, hospitals and blood banks go to great lengths to screen alt blood donors and their blood.  All donated blood is routinely and rigorously tested for diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. When the recipient is a newborn or an infant, the blood is usually irradiated to eliminate harmful elements.  Donated blood is washed, and the white blood cells and platelets removed. Storing the blood sometimes requires a freezing process. To freeze the red blood cells, a glycerol solution is added. To unfreeze the, the glycerol is removed.

Fans in this case may refer to the team as ‘they’ in order to distance themselves from their team’s disappointing match result. A dissatisfied fan is more likely to say ‘they played really badly’ as they want no responsibility for the depressing final score. Furthermore, they will be unlikely to wear any clothing that pinpoints them as a supporter after losing to a rival team.

People who may not be superstitious in other aspect of their life  will claim that wearing a certain item of lucky clothing will make their team play better.

('THPTQG-50', 'People have been donating blood since the early twentieth century to help accident victims and patients undergoing surgical procedures. Usually a pint of whole blood is donated, and it is then divided into platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells. People can donate blood (for red blood cells) about once every two \nmonths. Transfusing the blood from the donor to the recipient is straightforward. It involves taking the blood from a donor’s arm vein by means of a hypodermic syringe. The blood flows through a plastic tube to a collection bag or bottle that contains sodium citrate, which prevents the blood from clotting. When the blood is given to a patient, a plastic tube and hypodermic needle are connected to the recipient\'s arm. The blood flows down from the container by gravity. This is a slow process and may last as long as 2 hours to complete the infusion of blood into the recipient. The patient is protected from being infected during the transfusion. Only sterile containers, tubing, and needles are used, and this helps ensure that transfused or stored blood is not exposed to disease causing bacteria. Negative reactions to transfusions are not unusual.  The recipient may suffer an allergic reaction or be sensitive to donor leukocytes. Some may suffer from an undetected red cell incompatibility. Unexplained reactions are also fairly common. Although they are rare, other causes of such negative reactions include contaminated blood, air bubbles in the blood, overloading of the circulatory system through administration of excess blood, or sensitivity to donor plasma or platelets.

('THPTQG-57', 'DISABILITY ON TV\nNine official complaints have so far been lodged with the BBC - plus many more blog postings - about 29- year old children\'s television presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with only one hand. Parents have complained that they cannot let their children watch her because the sight will \"probably cause sleep problems\", that she is scaring toddlers, and that they are being forced to discuss the issue of disability with their offspring before they are ready. \nAltogether, it makes you glad that the medieval witch-hunters weren\'t Internet- enabled. The comments of course reveal nothing about the children\'s true feelings and everything about those of the adults involved.  Very young children do not have profound concerns about disability. I worked for several years, on and off, at a school for physically disabled children and it was never their able-bodied peers who were the problem when our paths crossed on school outings, but their parents, who kept them pinioned to their sides and made sure they turned their faces away. If a curious child ever did slip out of his mother\'s vice-like grip and come over, he or she would ask a few unabashed questions about what the problem was, want to press buttons on a few wheelchairs, and accept quite happily the explanations offered. To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever. To let your toddler be scared every day that Burnell has hurt herself rather than explain the truth is a failure of parenting, not an imposition by the BBAnd toddlers are frightened of lots of things. My two-year-old godson is currently terrified by trees (\"Too scary!  Too scary!\"). His mother isn\'t out felling all nearby arboreal horrors - she\'s taking him on extra visits to the park.\nSo, it should be here, though increasing exposure to presenters with disabilities is going to be tricky. I can only think of performer Mat Fraser, who appears occasionally on television, often presenting programmes about sing with the shortened limbs caused by Thalidomide, and even more occasional screen appearances by the actor and stand up comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most frequently seen is BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who has used a wheelchair Gardner since being shot while reporting from Riyadh five years ago. \nBut the strength of reaction to Burnell\'s missing hand shows that she remains something of a pioneer. There is still a lot of ignorance to get through. Or a lot of ignoramuses to get through to. \n(Source: The Guardian Online)', 'According to the passage, the complaints stem from parents ______.', 'Đoạn văn', 'whose children suffer from similar conditions and are now asking questions', 'who have uncovered information about the presenter on the Internet', 'whose children are suffering from nightmares', 'who are anxious about tackling controversial issues', 'D', ''),

('THPTQG-58', 'DISABILITY ON TV\nNine official complaints have so far been lodged with the BBC - plus many more blog postings - about 29- year old children\'s television presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with only one hand. Parents have complained that they cannot let their children watch her because the sight will \"probably cause sleep problems\", that she is scaring toddlers, and that they are being forced to discuss the issue of disability with their offspring before they are ready. \nAltogether, it makes you glad that the medieval witch-hunters weren\'t Internet- enabled. The comments of course reveal nothing about the children\'s true feelings and everything about those of the adults involved.  Very young children do not have profound concerns about disability. I worked for several years, on and off, at a school for physically disabled children and it was never their able-bodied peers who were the problem when our paths crossed on school outings, but their parents, who kept them pinioned to their sides and made sure they turned their faces away. If a curious child ever did slip out of his mother\'s vice-like grip and come over, he or she would ask a few unabashed questions about what the problem was, want to press buttons on a few wheelchairs, and accept quite happily the explanations offered. To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever. To let your toddler be scared every day that Burnell has hurt herself rather than explain the truth is a failure of parenting, not an imposition by the BBAnd toddlers are frightened of lots of things. My two-year-old godson is currently terrified by trees (\"Too scary!  Too scary!\"). His mother isn\'t out felling all nearby arboreal horrors - she\'s taking him on extra visits to the park.\nSo, it should be here, though increasing exposure to presenters with disabilities is going to be tricky. I can only think of performer Mat Fraser, who appears occasionally on television, often presenting programmes about sing with the shortened limbs caused by Thalidomide, and even more occasional screen appearances by the actor and stand up comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most frequently seen is BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who has used a wheelchair Gardner since being shot while reporting from Riyadh five years ago. \nBut the strength of reaction to Burnell\'s missing hand shows that she remains something of a pioneer. There is still a lot of ignorance to get through. Or a lot of ignoramuses to get through to. \n(Source: The Guardian Online)', 'Which of the following best describes those making the complaints?', 'Đoạn văn', 'reactionary', 'distasteful', 'contemptible', 'warranted', 'C', ''),

The comments of course reveal nothing about the children\'s true feelings and everything about those of the adults involved.  Very young children do not have profound concerns about disability. I worked for several years, on and off, at a school for physically disabled children and it was never their able-bodied peers who were the problem when our paths crossed on school outings, but their parents, who kept them pinioned to their sides and made sure they turned their faces away. If a curious child ever did slip out of his mother\'s vice-like grip and come over, he or she would ask a few unabashed questions about what the problem was, want to press buttons on a few wheelchairs, and accept quite happily the explanations offered. To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever. To let your toddler be scared every day that Burnell has hurt herself rather than explain the truth is a failure of parenting, not an imposition by the BBAnd toddlers are frightened of lots of things. My two-year-old godson is currently terrified by trees (\"Too scary!  Too scary!\"). His mother isn\'t out felling all nearby arboreal horrors - she\'s taking him on extra visits to the park.\nSo, it should be here, though increasing exposure to presenters with disabilities is going to be tricky. I can only think of performer Mat Fraser, who appears occasionally on television, often presenting programmes about sing with the shortened limbs caused by Thalidomide, and even more occasional screen appearances by the actor and stand up comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most frequently seen is BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who has used a wheelchair Gardner since being shot while reporting from Riyadh five years ago. \nBut the strength of reaction to Burnell\'s missing hand shows that she remains something of a pioneer.

To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever.

('THPTQG-631', 'TEXAS \nA Texas middle school is under fire after students say they have been banned from speaking Spanish in class.  The students say their principal announced the rule last month over the intercom. Inside the walls of  Hemptead Middle School, a language controversy is brewing. “There\'s one teacher that said, “If you speak  Spanish in my class, I\'m gonna write you up,” 8th grader Tiffani Resurez says. Four students say their  principal\'s announcement - banning them from speaking Spanish in class - has given teachers and fellow  students a hall pass to discriminate. “She was like, „No speaking Spanish.\' She told me that. I was like,  “That\'s my first language.’ She said, „Well, you can get out,\" fellow classmate Yedhany Gallegos says.

('THPTQG-64', 'DISABILITY ON TV\nNine official complaints have so far been lodged with the BBC - plus many more blog postings - about 29- year old children\'s television presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with only one hand. Parents have complained that they cannot let their children watch her because the sight will \"probably cause sleep problems\", that she is scaring toddlers, and that they are being forced to discuss the issue of disability with their offspring before they are ready. \nAltogether, it makes you glad that the medieval witch-hunters weren\'t Internet- enabled. The comments of course reveal nothing about the children\'s true feelings and everything about those of the adults involved.  Very young children do not have profound concerns about disability. I worked for several years, on and off, at a school for physically disabled children and it was never their able-bodied peers who were the problem when our paths crossed on school outings, but their parents, who kept them pinioned to their sides and made sure they turned their faces away. If a curious child ever did slip out of his mother\'s vice-like grip and come over, he or she would ask a few unabashed questions about what the problem was, want to press buttons on a few wheelchairs, and accept quite happily the explanations offered. To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever. To let your toddler be scared every day that Burnell has hurt herself rather than explain the truth is a failure of parenting, not an imposition by the BBAnd toddlers are frightened of lots of things. My two-year-old godson is currently terrified by trees (\"Too scary!  Too scary!\"). His mother isn\'t out felling all nearby arboreal horrors - she\'s taking him on extra visits to the park.\nSo, it should be here, though increasing exposure to presenters with disabilities is going to be tricky. I can only think of performer Mat Fraser, who appears occasionally on television, often presenting programmes about sing with the shortened limbs caused by Thalidomide, and even more occasional screen appearances by the actor and stand up comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most frequently seen is BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who has used a wheelchair Gardner since being shot while reporting from Riyadh five years ago. \nBut the strength of reaction to Burnell\'s missing hand shows that she remains something of a pioneer. There is still a lot of ignorance to get through. Or a lot of ignoramuses to get through to. \n(Source: The Guardian Online)', 'Choose the word that differs from the other three in the position of the primary stress: design, resolve, event, emblem', 'Đoạn văn', 'design', 'resolve', 'event', 'emblem', 'D', ''),

('THPTQG-65', 'DISABILITY ON TV\nNine official complaints have so far been lodged with the BBC - plus many more blog postings - about 29- year old children\'s television presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with only one hand. Parents have complained that they cannot let their children watch her because the sight will \"probably cause sleep problems\", that she is scaring toddlers, and that they are being forced to discuss the issue of disability with their offspring before they are ready. \nAltogether, it makes you glad that the medieval witch-hunters weren\'t Internet- enabled. The comments of course reveal nothing about the children\'s true feelings and everything about those of the adults involved.  Very young children do not have profound concerns about disability. I worked for several years, on and off, at a school for physically disabled children and it was never their able-bodied peers who were the problem when our paths crossed on school outings, but their parents, who kept them pinioned to their sides and made sure they turned their faces away. If a curious child ever did slip out of his mother\'s vice-like grip and come over, he or she would ask a few unabashed questions about what the problem was, want to press buttons on a few wheelchairs, and accept quite happily the explanations offered. To a young child, it is just another element of a large and confusing world that they want to find out about, no more fearsome or embarrassing than any other. No, Burnell\'s arm is likely only to give parents nightmares. It is they who do not want to confront disabilities, not now, not at teatime, not ever. To let your toddler be scared every day that Burnell has hurt herself rather than explain the truth is a failure of parenting, not an imposition by the BBAnd toddlers are frightened of lots of things. My two-year-old godson is currently terrified by trees (\"Too scary!  Too scary!\"). His mother isn\'t out felling all nearby arboreal horrors - she\'s taking him on extra visits to the park.\nSo, it should be here, though increasing exposure to presenters with disabilities is going to be tricky. I can only think of performer Mat Fraser, who appears occasionally on television, often presenting programmes about sing with the shortened limbs caused by Thalidomide, and even more occasional screen appearances by the actor and stand up comedian Francesca Martinez, who has cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most frequently seen is BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who has used a wheelchair Gardner since being shot while reporting from Riyadh five years ago. \nBut the strength of reaction to Burnell\'s missing hand shows that she remains something of a pioneer. There is still a lot of ignorance to get through. Or a lot of ignoramuses to get through to. \n(Source: The Guardian Online)', 'Choose the word that differs from the other three in the position of the primary stress: cosmopolitan, biological, infrastructural, presupposition', 'Đoạn văn', 'cosmopolitan', 'biological', 'infrastructural', 'presupposition', 'D', ''),

Many rural villages remain unreached by government schooling and adult literacy stood at just 60 percent in 2011. \nSurya Karki and his charity United World Schools Nepal (UWS) are tackling high illiteracy and poverty rates by funding and improving education. \nThe first school opened in 2015. Since then 92 percent of children have completed primary education, which finishes at age eight, and continued into secondary education with UWS schools, in comparison to 39 percent of students continuing education who attended government schools. \nMr Karki was born into poverty in rural Nepal. Speaking to the Telegraph he said: \"School is the only solution to the poverty cycle that we live in. I was raised by a single mother in a male-dominated society.  The school that I went to was approximately two hours’ walk away. My house was on top of a hill and my mother had to drag me across rivers. We used to walk 10 miles a day. The schooling was really bad.\"\nKarki\'s mother was a firm believer in education, and at age eight Karki secured a scholarship to study in the capital, Kathmandu. From there he won scholarships and completed Master\'s degrees in China and the United States. He returned to Nepal in 2015 and decided to stay and develop the education system. Karki said: \"Inequalities in a country can only be decreased if there is access to knowledge.\" \nThe devastating earthquake in 2015 damaged 9,300 schools, displacing hundreds of thousands of families and pushing 700,000 people into poverty. As of January 2018, only 2,891 schools had been rebuilt. Karki said: “We came at a crucial time, where we could redo or undo what had been done badly. Education was really bad in terms of infrastructure, quality of teachers and training. It was an opportunity for us to really make things better.\" \nUWS Nepal has so far built 30 schools and has seven more in construction. The schools run between 10 am and 3:30 pm, and have an 86 percent average attendance rate, which Karki says is almost double the attendance rate for government schools in the vicinity.

('THPTQG-792', 'Today we take electricity for granted and perhaps we do not realize just how useful this discovery has been. Steam was the first invention that replaced wind power. It was used to drive engines and was passed through pipes and radiators to warm rooms. Petrol mixed with air was the next invention that provided power. Exploded in a cylinder, it drove a motor engine. Beyond these simple and direct uses, those forms have not much adaptability.\nOn the other hand, we make use of electricity in thousands of ways. From the powerful voltages that drive our electric trains to the tiny current needed to work a simple calculator, and from the huge electric magnet in steel works that can lift 10 tons to the tiny electric magnet in a doorbell, all are powered by electricity. An electric current can be made with equal ease to heat a huge mass of molten metal in a furnace, or to boil a jug for a cup of coffee.\nOther than atomic energy, which has not as yet been harnessed to the full, electricity is the greatest power in the world. It is flexible, and so adaptable for any task for which it is wanted. It travels so easily and with incredible speed along wires or conductors that it can be supplied instantly over vast distances.\nTo generate electricity, huge turbines or generators must be turned. In Australia they use coal or water to drive this machinery. When dams are built, falling water is used to drive the turbines without polluting the atmosphere with smoke from coal. Atomic power is used in several countries but there is always the fear of an accident. A tragedy once occurred at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, at an atomic power plant used to make electricity. The reactor leaked, which caused many deaths through radiation.\nNow scientists are examining new ways of creating electricity without harmful effects to the environment. They may harness the tides as they flow in and out of bays. Most importantly, they hope to trap sunlight more efficiently. We do use solar heaters for swimming pools but as yet improvement in the capacity of the solar cells to create more current is necessary. When this happens, electric cars will be viable and the world will rid itself of the toxic gases given off by trucks and cars that burn fossil fuels.', 'The word \"they\" in paragraph 5 mentions __________', 'Đoạn văn', 'harmful effects', 'the tides', 'scientists', 'new ways', 'C', ''),

('THPTQG-987', 'Have you ever entered a tropical rainforest? It’s a special, dark place completely different from anywhere else. A rainforest is a place where the trees grow very tall. Millions of kinds of animals, insects, and plants live in the rainforest. It is hot and humid in a rainforest. It rains a lot in the rainforest, but sometimes you don’t know it’s raining. The trees grow so closely together that rain doesn’t always reach the ground.\nRainforests make up only a small part of the Earth’s surface, about six percent. They are found in tropical parts of the world. The largest rainforest in the world is the Amazon in South America. The Amazon covers 1.2 billion acres, or almost five million square kilometers. The second largest rainforest is in Western Africa. There are also rainforests in Central America, Southeast Asia, Northeastern Australia, and the Pacific Islands.\nRainforests provide us with many things. In fact, the Amazon Rainforest is called the “lungs of our planet” because it produces twenty percent of the world’s oxygen. One fifth of the world’s fresh water is also found in the Amazon Rainforest. Furthermore, one half of the world’s species of animals, plants, and insects live in the Earth’s rainforests. Eighty percent of the food we eat first grew in the rainforest. For example, pineapples, bananas, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, chocolate, coffee, and sugar all came from rainforests. Twenty-five percent of the drugs we take when we are sick are made of plants that grow only in rainforests. Some of these drugs are even used to fight and cure cancer. With all the good things we get from rainforests, it’s surprising to find that we are destroying our rainforests. In fact, 1.5 acres, or 6,000 square meters, of rainforest disappear every second. The forests are being cut down to make fields for cows, to harvest the plants, and to clear land for farms.

Eighty percent of the food we eat first grew in the rainforest. For example, pineapples, bananas, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, chocolate, coffee, and sugar all came from rainforests. Twenty-five percent of the drugs we take when we are sick are made of plants that grow only in rainforests. Some of these drugs are even used to fight and cure cancer. With all the good things we get from rainforests, it’s surprising to find that we are destroying our rainforests. In fact, 1.5 acres, or 6,000 square meters, of rainforest disappear every second. The forests are being cut down to make fields for cows, to harvest the plants, and to clear land for farms. Along with losing countless valuable species, the destruction of rainforests creates many problems worldwide. Destruction of rainforests results in more pollution, less rain, and less oxygen for the world.\n(Adapted from Reading Challenge 2 by Casey Malarcher and Andrea Janzen)', 'What can be inferred from the last passage?', 'Đoạn văn', 'People are not aware of the significance of the rainforests.', 'The consequences of deforestation are greater than what people can imagine.', 'The more rainforests are destroyed, the harder people’s life will become.', 'People’s economic benefits are more important than environmental problems.', 'C', ''),
